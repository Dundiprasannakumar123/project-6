Digital electronics is a branch of electronics that deals with the design, development and operation of circuits and systems that use digital signals instead of analog signals. Unlike analog electronics, which works with continuous signals, in digital electronics two different voltage levels are used to represent the binary values ​​0 and 1, known as bits.

Digital electronics are essential in the field of digital systems, such as computers, mobile phones, tablets and other electronic devices. These systems are made up of integrated circuits that contain millions of interconnected transistors, which allow the processing of information efficiently.

The operation of digital electronics is based on Boolean logic, which establishes the rules and operations necessary to manipulate and process binary data. Using logic gates, such as AND, OR, and NOT gates, operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division can be performed, as well as logical operations such as comparison and information storage.

To represent and store information in digital systems, the binary system is used, which is made up of the digits 0 and 1. These digits are grouped into bytes, which are units of information made up of 8 bits. In turn, the bytes are combined to form larger words, which can be interpreted as numbers, characters or instructions for the operation of a system.

Digital electronics is also responsible for the design of sequential circuits.
